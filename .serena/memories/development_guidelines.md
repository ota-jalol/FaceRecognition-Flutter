# Development Guidelines and Best Practices

## Flutter/Dart Best Practices

### Widget Development
- **Prefer StatelessWidget** when state is not needed
- **Use const constructors** for immutable widgets to improve performance
- **Implement proper disposal** in StatefulWidget to prevent memory leaks
- **Use BuildContext appropriately** - don't store it in class fields
- **Prefer composition over inheritance** for widget reusability

### Asynchronous Programming
- **Always handle errors** in async/await operations
- **Use try-catch blocks** instead of empty catch statements
- **Check widget mounting** before calling setState() in async callbacks
- **Proper Future cancellation** when widgets are disposed

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimize widget rebuilds** by using appropriate state management
- **Use ListView.builder** for large lists instead of Column with many children
- **Optimize image loading** and caching for better memory usage
- **Profile app performance** regularly during development

## Face Recognition Specific Guidelines

### Camera Integration
- **Always check camera permissions** before accessing camera
- **Properly handle camera lifecycle** (start/stop) during navigation
- **Handle platform differences** between Android and iOS camera APIs
- **Implement proper error handling** for camera initialization failures

### Face SDK Usage
- **Secure license key management** - avoid hardcoding in source code
- **Proper SDK initialization** with error handling and retry logic
- **Resource cleanup** - dispose SDK resources when not needed
- **Thread safety** - ensure SDK calls are made on appropriate threads

### Performance Optimization
- **Limit face detection frequency** to avoid excessive CPU usage
- **Optimize face image processing** to minimize memory allocation
- **Use appropriate detection levels** based on device capabilities
- **Implement proper face template caching** for better recognition speed

## Code Organization Patterns

### File Naming and Structure
- **Group related functionality** in the same file when appropriate
- **Separate UI, business logic, and data layers** clearly
- **Use meaningful file and class names** that describe their purpose
- **Keep files reasonably sized** - split large files into smaller modules

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Define custom exception classes** for different error types
- **Implement graceful degradation** when features are unavailable
- **Provide user-friendly error messages** instead of technical details
- **Log errors appropriately** for debugging while respecting privacy

### Testing Strategy
- **Write unit tests** for business logic and utility functions
- **Use widget tests** for UI component testing
- **Implement integration tests** for critical user flows
- **Mock external dependencies** (camera, SDK) for reliable testing

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encrypt sensitive biometric data** before storage
- **Implement proper user consent** mechanisms for biometric collection
- **Follow platform guidelines** for biometric data handling
- **Regularly audit data retention** policies and cleanup old data

### Privacy Best Practices
- **Minimize data collection** to what's necessary for functionality
- **Provide clear privacy policies** regarding face data usage
- **Implement user control** over their biometric data
- **Follow GDPR/CCPA compliance** requirements where applicable
